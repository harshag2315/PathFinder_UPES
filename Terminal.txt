To run over terminal you should have node and C++ Compiler available in the system

So steps after node is already there-> 
1. cd path/to/pathfinder-project
2. g++ -o pathfindex.exe pathfinder.cpp
3. npm init -y
4. npm install express
5. node server.js

Open Chrome and type - https://localhost:3001
